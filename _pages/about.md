Hello, I'm Prateek Jaiswal, my specilization is Computer Vision and Biometrics, I work under the guidance of Professor [Dr. Anoop M Namboodiri](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~anoop/). My research revolves around the fascinating intersection of computer vision and biometrics.

I've had the privilege of collaborating on significant projects with esteemed organizations. I contributed to the Manual VIDEO KYC and SDK benchmarking initiatives for [UIDAI](https://uidai.gov.in/), a critical player in India's digital identity landscape. Furthermore, I engaged in an exciting collaboration with [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/), USA, on a Face Demorphing project.

In addition to my research commitments, I've also served as a Teaching Assistant and Moderator for the Summer of Computer Vision program at IIIT Hyderabad.

Before embarking on my research journey in Hyderabad, I completed my Bachelor of Engineering from [RGPV University](https://www.rgpv.ac.in/) in Bhopal, where my passion for computer science first ignited. I had also worked for [Cognizant](https://www.cognizant.com/).

Beyond the world of computer science, I am an avid sports enthusiast, finding joy in activities such as running and trekking. One of my proudest achievements was conquering the 70Km-long [Kedarnath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kedarnath_Temple) trek, a testament to my determination and love for outdoor adventures.

My love for exploring extends beyond physical challenges; I'm an avid traveler who revels in discovering the beauty of nature and immersing myself in diverse cultures. To facilitate meaningful connections with people from different backgrounds, I dedicate my spare time to learning various languages. Feel free to connect with me to discuss exciting research opportunities, share travel stories, or engage in conversations about language and culture!
