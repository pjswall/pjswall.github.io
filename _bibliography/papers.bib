  author={Banerjee, Sudipta and Jaiswal, Prateek and Ross, Arun},
  abstract={In the field of biometric security, the quality assessment of fingerprint images is paramount for boosting the accuracy of fingerprint recognition systems. 
  These systems are fundamental for the secure and efficient authentication and identification of individuals. Our research presents FRBQ (Fingerprint Recognition-Based Quality), 
  an innovative quality metric designed to navigate the limitations of the NFIQ2 model. FRBQ exploits deep learning algorithms in a weakly supervised setting and 
  utilizes matching scores from DeepPrint, a Fixed-Length Fingerprint Representation Model. Each score is paired with labels indicating the robustness of fingerprint 
  image matches. However, in a fully referenced setting, these labels can be subjective, lacking a clear definition of what "image quality" inherently means. 
  This weakly labeled approach strives to capture diverse perspectives on image quality, potentially making it a more encompassing metric. In comparison to NFIQ2, 
  our research showcases the superior performance of the FRBQ model. It not only correlates better with recognition scores but also effectively evaluates challenging 
  images that NFIQ2 struggles with. Validated by the esteemed FVC 2004 dataset, FRBQ proves its efficacy in fingerprint image quality assessment. This study underscores the 
  transformative potential of AI in biometrics, emphasizing its capability to capture details that traditional methods might overlook. 
  Our work stresses the critical role of precise quality assessment in the evolution of fingerprint recognition systems.},
